/**
* 👉 Problem: Nth FibonacciNumber
* 👑 Description: Find the Nth Fibonacci Number.
* 🎓 Explanation(optional):Any fibonacci number is give by sum of last two fibonacci number
*    before the number.
*    Ex. 
*    F(N):  0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...
*    N   :  0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8....
*    f(n)= {
*               0 for  n==0
*               1 for n==1
*               f(n-1)+f(n-2) otherwise
*          }
