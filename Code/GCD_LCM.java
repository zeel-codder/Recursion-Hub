/**
 * 👉 Problem: GCD and LCM of two numbers 
 * 👑 Description: Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers 
 * 🎓 Explanation(optional):The Greatest Common Divisor (also
 * known as GCD) is the largest number that divides evenly into each number in a
 * given set of numbers.
 * The Least Common Multiple (also known as LCM) is the smallest 
 * positive multiple that is common to two or more numbers.
 * 
 * Example:
 * GCD(12,18)=6
 * LCM(12,18)=36
 * Detailed Explanation can be found on https://calcworkshop.com/fractions/gcf-lcm/
